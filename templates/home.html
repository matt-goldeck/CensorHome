          <p>The Network Science Lab (NetSci) in the Department of Computer Science at Montclair State University is dedicated to the study of the intersection between social behavior and computational systems.  NetSci supports a broad range of topics including: Internet censorship, Internet of Things (IoT), security and privacy, and the modeling and analysis of technological and online social networks.  Researchers in lab have expertise in network analytic methods, machine learning, and natural language processing.</p>
          <p>An experimental test-bed enables exploration and simulation activities that support the underlying research conducted in the lab.  <a href="/static/img/net_arch.png">Overview of the network topology</a> that supports our research. </p>
